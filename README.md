# FCEF - And loader
Welcome.<br>
We are thinking a question - "Should we create a new format for E-comOS?" . In first week , we think "No , we don't need , we just use we had format - such as ELF", but after few weeks , we ... think we are wrong , we need a new format , or , HOW CAN WE KNOW "WHO IS LINUX APPS?" " WHO IS E-COMOS APPS!?"<br>
So , we create this project
## It Can DO
It can:
- 1. You can use it to make yourself apps , it can running in E-comOS VERY WELL.
- 2. It is with ECLC , it means you can USE ECLC TO MAKE A FCEF FORMAT FILE
- 3. IT IS A "CAN RUN" FILE
## How to work  
You only need open file , loader will do other thing of that.
